mechanics
----------
[x] use real cuboids instead of fake ones
[x] ease the creation of cuboids, width, depth, x y coord from center
[x] determine and draw faces, 3 faces with the highest average z should be forward facing
[x] use a camera to enable changing perspective? 
[] determine overlap of a placed cuboid to the one beneath it
[x] use crank to change perspective
[] use accelerometer to change perspective
[x] camera centers on last stacked cuboid
[] perfect stacks emit a ring or particles
[] non perfect stacks shrink the cuboid to fit on the one below
[] remainder cuboid is created, falls off screen and is then freed
[] score = number of items on stack, update UI
